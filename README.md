# react-virtualized-listview
A simple virtualized listview inspired by react-virtualized

## Getting started
The first step is to add `react-virtualized-listview` into your project.

```sh
$ npm install --save react-virtualized-listview
```

**Note:** This library is not dependent on `react-virtualized` which is a separate and highly customizable virtualized list library.

## Usage
Import the package into your project using the `import` statement
```js
import List from 'react-virtualized-listview';
```

### Example
```jsx
const data = [{
  number: 1,
  height: 40
}, {
  number: 2,
  height: 40
},{
  number: 3,
  height: 40
}, {
  number: 4,
  height: 40
}, {
  number: 5,
  height: 40
}];

<List
  source={data}
  renderItem={({ index, style }) => (
    <div key={index} style={style}>
      Hello {index}
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

| source        |   [ ]   |    Yes    | An array of the input source. The array is iterated over and index of each item is returned in the `renderItem` prop. *source.item* shold be have *height* property.                                                                                                         |
| rowHeight     |    24   |     No    | The height of each row in the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| overScanCount |    5    |     No    | The number of rows to render above and below the visible list window. This is to have some rows already rendered while scrolling above or below the visible list window so that they don't pop in as soon as the list is scrolled. |
| renderItem    |         |    Yes    | The function that is called when rendering each row.|

### renderItem
The renderItem function signature is as follows
```jsx
({
  index, // The index of each item in the source prop
  style // The style that is applied to the row item
}) => <RowItem key={index} index={index} style={style}/>
```
**Note:** Passing the `style` prop and applying in the root element of the row item is **required**

## Features planned for next release
- Expose internal components using default CSS classnames, custom classname injection and refs
- Add scroll persistence so that the scroll position persists between route changes
